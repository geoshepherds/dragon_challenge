The Dragon Challenge application visualises physical literacy of children in Wales.
Each participant completes a series of tasks where the results from each task are combined into a final score. The scores are then divided into award categories of Bronze, Bronze Star, Silver, Silver Star, Gold, Gold Star and Platinum.

The map shows the most prevalent awards across Wales with the bar chart displaying the total breakdown of awards within the active region.
